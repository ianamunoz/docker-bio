Trimmomatic Usage
=================


Running Trimmomatic on your own data-sets
-----------------------------------------
We will create a bowtie container, attaching your local current working directory (assuming your
data-sets sit in this folder), and run bowtie on the data, without manually attaching to the
container.
```
docker run
```
